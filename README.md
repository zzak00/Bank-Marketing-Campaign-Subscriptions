# Bank Marketing Campaign Subscriptions
### A direct marketing campaign of a Portuguese banking institution to their clients

Context:
----

The dataset contains information about marketing campaigns that were conducted via phone calls from a Portuguese banking institution to their clients. Purpose of these campaigns is to prompt their clients to subscribe for a specific financial product of the bank (term deposit). After each call was conducted, the client had to inform the institution about their intention of either subscribing to the product (indicating a successful campaign) or not (unsucessful campaign).
The final output of this survey will be a binary result indicating if the client subscribed ('yes') to the product or not ('no').

The dataset has 41188 rows (instances of calls to clients) and 21 columns (variables) which are describing certain aspects of the call. Please note that there are cases where the same client was contacted multiple times - something that practically doesn't affect the analysis as each call will be considered independent from another even if the client is the same.
